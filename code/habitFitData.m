% FR-20: 16 rats trained for 30 daily sessions (sessions terminated when 50 rewards were earned or 1 hour elapsed, whichever occurred first). Each rat was administered a specific satiety devaluation test after sessions 2, 10, 20, and 30.
% RR-20: 15 rats trained and tested in an identical manner to the FR-20 rats.
% FI-45: 8 rats trained for 20 daily sessions (sessions lasted a fixed 38 minutes). Each rat was administered a specific satiety devaluation test after sessions 2, 10, and 20.
% RI-45: 39 rats. Think of these rats as belonging to 3 different cohorts. Cohort 1 (n = 8) was trained for 20 daily sessions and tested after sessions 2, 10, and 20. Cohort 2 (n = 16) was trained for 2 daily sessions and only tested after session 2. Cohort 3 (n = 15) was trained for 20 daily sessions and only tested after session 20. Sessions always lasted a fixed 38 minutes.
