analysis
- how does action rate change over learning?
- calculate "beta" 
- show that beta should increase for high contingency 
    - start large: low cost, if gets smaller, it means that cost to pay is getting larger

notes
- "learned" O matrix is same for all schedules, only see reward if they have just pressed and end up in state 1 
- initialize O matrix to 0.5 for all?

- question: if cost is always bounded by 0, but my policy pi(a|s) = [0.5 0.5] and pa = [0 1]
